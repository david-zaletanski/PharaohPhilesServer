# Pharaoh Philes Server

**Updated README:** 1/28/2018

Dug this out of the archives today (made pre-2014), but I believe in this project, I basically set out to write my own FTP server/client implementation in C#. The server has a thread safe implementation that can manage multiple clients connecting to it. The client application looks mostly used for testing purposes. Might have some interesting tidbits in it.
